# CryoEM_Scripts
A collection of crude scripts and workarounds for CryoEM

`rename_image_shift.py` will rename movies based on the image shift position from SerialEM mdoc files. Do this when you collect data with SerialEM multishot and forget to check the box to save files with the position in the name.

The safest way to run this is to make a new directory and symlink all the movies and corresponding mdoc files. <pre>python rename_image_shift.py</pre>
